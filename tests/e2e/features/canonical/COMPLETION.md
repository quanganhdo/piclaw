# UX specification completion matrix

The #1323 audit covered **25 feature files, 241 scenarios/outlines and 25 example rows**. Follow-up #1324 separates the desired SVG-image contract from that baseline: the current inventory has **26 files, 248 scenarios/outlines and 44 example rows**, including eight shared implemented cases. Structural validity is separate from implementation and browser acceptance.

## SVG follow-up (#1324 / #1325)

- `ux-original-029` now retains the desired SVG-image scope in `shared/svg-images.feature`; 70d33bc93 source-only behaviour remains dated evidence.
- The obsolete hash/path oracle is replaced by structural checks, not a claim that planned features pass.
- Browser baseline coverage and commands are recorded in [SVG evidence](audit/svg-images.md).
- [x] Implement and browser-validate shared SVG images in both skins (#1325); see [coverage](audit/svg-images.md).

## Historical #1323 baselines and scope

- PR: [#1323](https://github.com/rcarmo/piclaw/pull/1323).
- Production source baseline: `f1a9d979d4ad5bb9c740b1ddf69f8c6c4ff245b4`.
- Original input: `9607cc4911f3a2a96566af2ddf127f5fabbfe16e`, 20 feature files, 28 new original scenarios.
- Reconciled PR head: `3f8ee0d2f9eddab3828f9a5d4f626716469636d8`, adding the SVG request and upstream immutable test update. It was adopted without modifying application behaviour.
- Audit changes: Gherkin and completion/index/evidence Markdown only. Executable tests, production code, dependencies and generated bundles are unchanged from that head.
- Skin-folder reorganisation base: `418764ee40d0bac63500942bb9134bcef40e23a2`. All 241 scenario semantics are preserved; splitting the mixed interaction feature increases the file count from 24 to 25.
- Classic is authoritative on doubt. Visual contracts have explicit skin tags. [Skin differences](audit/differences.md) and [review dispositions](audit/review.md) prevent inferred parity.
- Plan requires external add-on revision `6374ed3c85627c590794e44828d13b08587ba46b`. Tau/Vibes sources are outside this repository and were not verified.

## Completion checklist

- [x] Inventory all twenty input feature files and preserve the original twenty-eight scenario IDs.
- [x] Reconcile the subsequent SVG scenario as original-029 against the actual renderer.
- [x] Correct original and adjacent Gherkin against Classic implementation.
- [x] Add core auth/family, Settings, workspace/editor, recovery and interaction coverage.
- [x] Index every scenario below and link its source-evidence packet.
- [x] Complete bounded independent reviews and reconcile findings, rejected claims and failed attempts.
- [x] Record Visual differences, optional capabilities and safety deviations.
- [x] Organise all Gherkin into disjoint Classic and Visual import roots; preserve all 241 scenario definitions and update evidence links.
- [x] Validate Gherkin syntax, stable IDs, source paths, Markdown links and allowed-file scope.
- [x] Run local runtime/feature/build gates and type checking; record exact outcomes.
- [x] Run the untouched canonical contract test separately and retain its failure.
- [x] Commit and publish audit changes to PR #1323; [delivery receipt](audit/delivery.md) records commit `cd65da9f1` and confirmed publication.

## Historical #1323 acceptance limits

- The legacy oracle failed the old path/hash during #1323. It is replaced by structural checks in #1324; that repair does not fulfil the future renderer acceptance.
- [ ] Every clause has a direct executable assertion. Related test paths are evidence leads, not per-clause coverage.
- [ ] Browser scenarios are executed. No browser suite was run in this audit.
- [ ] Full cross-skin/port parity is verified. Only the bounded differences in the linked packet were source checked.

These historical acceptance limits do not describe #1324 validation or authorise production changes, merging or reloading. [Validation](audit/validation.md) records the passing fast gate separately from the failing immutable oracle.

## Core surface inventory

| Surface | Coverage / boundary |
|---|---|
| Shell/menu/Quick Actions/pickers | original-001–008,013–015,020–022; shell and session regression features |
| Compose/queue/uploads/reconnect | original-016–019,023,026; compose/context/reconnect regression features |
| Plan | original-009–012, conditional on external add-on |
| Timeline/rendering/annotations/speech/tools | original-024–029; timeline features; thoughts/status scenarios |
| Auth/OOBE/invitations/family privacy/sign-out | auth-001–014; owner restrictions in settings-011 and original-025 |
| All sixteen Classic built-in Settings sections | settings-001–030, including General, Sessions, Recordings, Quick Actions, Tools, Add-ons, Compaction, Budget, Keyboard, Scheduled Tasks, Workspace, Environment, Providers, Models, Appearance and Keychain |
| Registered Editor/Developer settings | settings-031–032; local browser preferences, no server save |
| Workspace/viewers/editor/terminal/VNC | workspace-001–018 plus editor/terminal regressions; unsupported in-pane search not invented |
| BTW/Adaptive Cards/widgets | extra-001–005; live and persisted widget lifecycles distinguished |
| Visual search/tasks/scratchpad | extra-006–010; scoped Visual behaviour |
| Notifications/recovery | extra-011–013; General recovery preferences; outcome marker timeline feature |
| Mobile/PWA | pwa-001–006, mobile scenarios and responsive/focus dimensions in other features; installation is browser-controlled |
| Other optional add-ons and native hosts | Capability boundary only; no claim of every external add-on or native-host implementation coverage |

## Skin-specific imports

| Skin | Import glob | Feature files | Scenarios/outlines | Example rows |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Classic (current) | `tests/e2e/features/classic/**/*.feature` | 24 | 235 | 25 |
| Visual (current) | `tests/e2e/features/visual/**/*.feature` | 1 | 5 | 0 |
| Shared (both skins, browser-verified) | `tests/e2e/features/shared/**/*.feature` | 1 | 8 | 19 |

The #1323 mixed-interaction split preserved scenario semantics. #1324 changes only the original SVG scenario scope and adds seven planned acceptance cases. The five current Visual scenarios remain extra-006–010. #1325 promotes SVG into shared/ without duplicate IDs. Audit documents stay outside the import roots. [Import guidance](../README.md) explains the planned/current split and structural test limits.
