# Provider/model pricing reference

_Reference tag: 2026-09-05_

This file records the sources and assumptions behind the token chart's **estimated API-equivalent** costs. The executable resolver is `provider-model-pricing-reference.ts`. The route-specific `pricing-2026-09-05.json` snapshot takes precedence; older fallback rules retain their original source dates.

## September 2026 refresh

- Adds GPT-6 Astra, Claude Fable 5/5.1 and all publicly priced OpenRouter routes in the retrieved snapshot.
- Fable 5.1 cache reads: $0.25/MTok; Fable 5: $1/MTok. Both use $10 input, $50 output and $12.50 5m cache writes.
- Direct OpenAI/Copilot Sol: $4 input/$20 output; OpenRouter Sol: $2/$10 at retrieval. Route identity is preserved.
- Astra: $10 input/$50 output/$1 cached input/$12.50 cache writes in the short-context tier. Long-context charges require request-level estimation outside this chart helper.
- Unknown cache tariffs use ordinary input as a conservative estimate, never free-cache assumptions.
- Copilot now documents token-based AI credits (1 credit = $0.01); allowances and budgets still affect the invoice. Codex uses ChatGPT subscription allowances, so API-equivalent costs are not its bill.
- Sources: [OpenAI](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing.md), [Anthropic](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing.md), [Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-billing/models-and-pricing.md), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models).
- The tables below remain historical documentation for fallback rows; consult the snapshot for refreshed routes. No historical ledger rows are rewritten.

## Source hierarchy

1. First-party provider pricing/documentation.
2. The live OpenRouter `/api/v1/models` response for OpenRouter-specific routes.
3. Explicitly labeled estimator fallbacks only when a provider does not publish a meter needed by local telemetry.

## Interpretation and limitations

- GitHub Copilot, Codex, Claude subscriptions, Fire Pass, and Azure agreements are **not** token-priced invoices. Their rows show underlying public API-equivalent value unless a separate subscription analysis is performed.
- Provider-specific routes are resolved separately where prices differ. A native model ID must not silently inherit an OpenRouter or Azure price.
- A cache value marked `†` is an estimator fallback, not a published provider cache tariff. Because local telemetry can report cache reads/writes outside ordinary input, the estimator explicitly charges those tokens at ordinary input price rather than silently treating them as free.
- GPT-5.6 has a published cache-write price; GPT-5.5, GPT-5.4, and older OpenAI rows do not. GPT-5.5's `$5/MTok` cache-write value is therefore an estimator fallback, not an official cache-write tariff.
- OpenAI rates are the standard `<=272K` input tier. Higher long-context rates are not modeled.
- Anthropic cache-write values are the 5-minute TTL rates. One-hour writes are higher and are not represented by the single local cache-write field. Opus 5 Fast mode is represented separately because it is priced at 2x the standard Opus 5 base rate.
- Claude Opus 4.6 (1M) currently uses the standard Opus row; context-related premiums or geo multipliers are not modeled.
- Fire Pass coverage is account-specific. Fireworks fast/turbo routers use PAYG rates here; a subscription comparison may subtract covered usage separately.
- OpenRouter rows represent credits consumed at the displayed token rates. They exclude OpenRouter's separate 5.5% credit-purchase fee ($0.80 minimum), which cannot be allocated reliably per model or request.
- Azure publishes only input/output prices for DeepSeek V4 Flash. Its cache-read and cache-write fields are conservatively modeled at ordinary input price and are not published Azure cache tariffs.
- Local inference is `$0` only for metered API cost. Electricity, hardware depreciation, and operations are excluded.

## Subscription-plan cross-check (not used by the resolver)

Checked 2026-07-14. Subscription allowances and PAYG token prices are not interchangeable.

| Product | Current individual tiers | Included allowance / reset | After included allowance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI Codex | Free $0; Go $8; Plus $20; Pro $100 (5x); Pro $200 (20x) per month | Model-specific usage allowance shared in a 5-hour window, with additional weekly limits. The active Codex usage dashboard is authoritative; static message counts are not stable enough to use as a monthly-capacity estimate. | Eligible Plus/Pro users can buy additional ChatGPT credits after reaching included limits; Codex's token credit card maps to standard API rates. API-key usage is separately billed PAYG. |
| Claude | Pro $20; Max 5x $100; Max 20x $200 per month | Max provides 5x/20x Pro session usage; five-hour session and separate weekly limits apply. Anthropic does not publish a fixed monthly token or dollar allowance. | Optional usage credits continue at standard API rates; otherwise usage pauses until reset. API Console usage remains separate from the subscription. |
| GitHub Copilot | Pro $10; Pro+ $39; Max $100 per month | Current primary table lists $15/$70/$200 in total monthly GitHub AI Credits respectively (base plus variable flex allotment); 1 GitHub AI Credit = $0.01. | Optional paid usage requires a dollar budget; otherwise wait for the monthly reset or use a cheaper model. GitHub's interaction-credit accounting is not the same as raw API-token costing. |
| Z.AI GLM Coding Plan | List prices: Lite $18; Pro $72; Max $160 per month. The subscribe page displayed promotional $12.60/$50.40/$112 prices when checked. | About 80/400/1,600 prompts per 5 hours and 400/2,000/8,000 per week. GLM-5.2 is charged 2x off-peak or 3x peak against plan quota. | Published plan documentation describes quota resets, not automatic PAYG overage; native API PAYG is a separate route. |
