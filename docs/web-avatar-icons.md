# Avatar and install icons

Explicit avatar updates validate and refresh the source before changing the active
identity. Reusing a file path or remote URL refreshes its content. Ordinary image
GETs reuse the cache and do not refetch the source.

## Updates and reset

Settings and `/agent-avatar` use the same avatar cache. Agent and user avatar
commands reject unavailable or undecodable images and keep the previous identity.
Settings reports a failed image update instead of reporting success with old
artwork. Clearing through Settings or `/agent-avatar clear` stores an empty avatar;
it does not reinstate the previous value. Identity setters persist these changes.

Cached images carry a SHA-256 content revision. Avatar URLs, manifest icon URLs and
browser icon-link cache busters use that revision. Identical processed artwork can
keep the same revision even when its source changes. Cache writes use temporary
files and atomic renames; work is serialised per avatar kind. A passive request
captured before an explicit update cannot overwrite the refreshed cache afterwards.

The web command path and Settings broadcast `profile_update`. Classic, Visual and
family subscribe. Family receives only public instance name and agent-avatar URL;
operator user identity and arbitrary profile fields are removed at the SSE boundary.
Initial/reconnected pages hydrate from the already-public manifest. An older
manifest response cannot overwrite a newer profile event. Family branding represents
the instance, independently of the signed-in account's avatar.

## Generated images

- Agent source preprocessing uses a maximum 512-pixel bound and strips EXIF.
- `/favicon.ico` serves a centre-cropped 48×48 PNG, with the static ICO as fallback.
- Apple icon routes serve square PNGs at 152, 167 or 180 pixels; the unsized and
  precomposed routes use 180 pixels.
- Manifest `any` icons are square 192/512 PNGs. Separate `maskable` variants fit the
  complete image in a centred square whose side is 56% of the canvas, inside the
  central 80%-diameter safe circle, on an opaque white background.
- `format=png` converts cached JPEG/SVG/GIF/WebP originals too. A failed conversion
  does not return a misleading non-PNG response. Shell icon routes use static
  fallback assets.
- Transformed HEAD requests omit the body and avoid pixel conversion. They omit
  Content-Length because computing it would require encoding the image.
- Manifest responses use `no-store`; generated PNGs use `no-cache`; original avatar
  responses use `no-store`. The service worker does not cache these assets.

## iOS installation

Page-level Apple icon links and the Apple app title update with instance branding.
An already-installed Home Screen icon is managed by iOS; the web app cannot force
its replacement. Linux WebKit tests cover links, titles and events, not native
installation or icon-refresh timing.

For physical-device acceptance, install with avatar A, switch to B, inspect the
open page, relaunch the installed app, inspect the Home Screen icon, and compare a
fresh Add to Home Screen installation. Record the device, OS and elapsed time.
Re-adding is a diagnostic step, not a promise of automatic refresh.

## Regression coverage

The avatar fixture uses disposable files/config and real Sharp processing. It
covers same-path replacement, stable content hashes, reset/set persistence in a
fresh process, failed-source preservation, queued stale reads, maskable corners,
PNG formats and sizes, and HEAD bodies. Server projection tests reject private
fields and revoked clients. Shipped Classic/Visual browser fixtures cover profile
updates, clears and reloads in Chromium/WebKit. A shipped family-shell fixture
checks initial branding, live changes and clear without changing account identity.
